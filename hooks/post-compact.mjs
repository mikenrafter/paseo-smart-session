/**
 * The compaction hook, registered on two events because neither one can do the
 * whole job.
 *
 * `PostCompact` is the event that knows a compaction happened and carries the
 * summary and its trigger — but Claude Code's hook-output schema has no
 * `PostCompact` variant, so anything it returns in `hookSpecificOutput` is
 * rejected wholesale and injects nothing. It is used here for what it can do:
 * record the compaction, reset the threshold latch so the warnings are available
 * again in the emptied window, and leave the state-file pointer pending.
 *
 * `SessionStart` with `source: "compact"` runs in the fresh context and *does*
 * accept `additionalContext`, so it delivers the pointer. If it never fires, the
 * `PostToolUse` threshold hook delivers the same note on the next tool call.
 * Either way it is said exactly once — see hooks/pointer.mjs.
