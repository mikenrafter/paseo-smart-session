/**
 * A PostToolUse hook that tells the agent how full it is — but only when that has
 * just become worth saying.
 *
 * Sensing is useless if the agent has to remember to ask. This runs after every
 * tool call, stays completely silent below the first threshold, and injects one
 * short line the moment context crosses each band. Each level fires once per
 * compaction epoch, so a long session gets three sentences, not three hundred.
 *
 * It describes; it never asks for anything. Deciding that a session should compact
 * belongs at a turn boundary, and that is `ask-compact.mjs` on `Stop`.
 *
 * It reads the transcript rather than asking Paseo, so it works in any Claude Code
 * session, and it reads only the tail of it, because this runs on the hot path.
