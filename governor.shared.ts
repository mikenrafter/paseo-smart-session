/**
 * The Governor: letting an agent compact itself.
 *
 * An agent cannot run `/compact` — it is a client command, not something the model
 * can invoke. But Paseo parses slash commands out of any message sent to an agent
 * and honours the root-only set, `compact` included, so a request routed through
 * the daemon becomes a real compaction with real custom instructions. Verified end
 * to end: 39,325 -> 6,160 tokens with instructions honoured (RESEARCH.md §7.1).
